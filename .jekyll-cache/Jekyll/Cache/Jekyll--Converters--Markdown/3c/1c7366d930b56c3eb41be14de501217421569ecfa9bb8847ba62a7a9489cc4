I"ò<p>Typologer is a typology of typologies. A typology is a classification ofâ€¦ stuff. This is a database of databases. There are a lot of beautiful weirdos out there with collections. Iâ€™ve always loved the way special interests cast a lens over the world.</p>

<p>You can see all things in one thing and one thing in all.</p>

<p>If you know a good index I should list, or a good list I should index, holler.</p>
