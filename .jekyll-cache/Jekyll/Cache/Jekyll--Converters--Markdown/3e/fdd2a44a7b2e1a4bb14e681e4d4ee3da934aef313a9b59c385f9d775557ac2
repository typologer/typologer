<p>This one can be fun even if you arenâ€™t into Math, just cuz itâ€™s prettyâ€¦</p>

<p>This is a list of mathematical knots, not the more useful ones like a bowline.
Usually in text books, these knots are drawn flat, but itâ€™s cool to see some 3d models that you can rotate.
I have a book on knot theory and it is some of the most beautiful pile of oh god why Iâ€™ve stumbled upon.
Billions of knots have been listed, but itâ€™s a computationally challenging field.
Comparing equivalence can be challenging. For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perko_pair">Perko Pair</a>.
I was only kind of able to get Knot Plot working on my Linux box, but itâ€™s pretty cool to be able to dial up any that you want to check out!</p>

<p>There are some other highlights on the Knot Plot site like these <a href="https://www.knotplot.com/carpets/knot-carpets.html">carpets</a></p>
