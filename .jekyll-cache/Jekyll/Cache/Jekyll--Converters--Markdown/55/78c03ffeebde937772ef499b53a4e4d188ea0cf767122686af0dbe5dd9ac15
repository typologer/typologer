I"ï<p>As much as I have loved Fiction, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the banal wildness of the reference section. Itâ€™s my childhood dictionary and itâ€™s tables; itâ€™s the drawers full of index cards at the library; itâ€™s in every see also section on wikipedia; itâ€™s getting cdâ€™s from music trader.
Thereâ€™s just so much potential in what all can fit in a database. Then once reality is ignored and everything is put in a similarly shaped box, you can do math on what you think you see!</p>
