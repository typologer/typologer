<p>This one can be fun even if you arenâ€™t into Math, just cuz itâ€™s prettyâ€¦</p>

<p>This is a list of mathematical knots, not the more useful ones like a bowline.
Usually in text books, these knots are drawn flat, but itâ€™s cool to see some 3d models that you can rotate.
I have a book on knot theory and it is some of the most beautiful pile of oh god why Iâ€™ve stumbled upon.
Billions of knots have been listed, but itâ€™s a computationally challenging field.
Comparing equivalence can be challenging. For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perko_pair">Perko Pair</a>.</p>
