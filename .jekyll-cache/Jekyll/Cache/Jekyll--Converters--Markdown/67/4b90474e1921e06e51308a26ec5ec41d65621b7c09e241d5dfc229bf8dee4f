I"A<p>As much as I have loved Fiction, I’ve always been drawn to the banal wildness of the reference section. It’s my childhood dictionary and it’s tables; it’s the drawers full of index cards at the library; it’s in every see also section on wikipedia; it’s getting cd’s from music trader.
There’s just so much potential in what all can fit in a database. Then once reality is ignored and everything is put in a similarly shaped box, you can do math on what you think you see!</p>

<p>Here I will be making more of the trash the internet is already littered with. Indexes of indexes, listicles of listicles. I want to shine a spotlight on special interest, narrow and wide. I love you, you beautiful weirdos.</p>

<p>This is likely a coping mechanism to deal with the loss (hiatus) of kottke.org (please come back)</p>
