<p>Maybe I’ve just listened to too much 99% invisible, but infrastructure can feel so mysterious, ubiquitous and underapreciated.</p>

<p>We sling data around all sorts of ways, and being a programmer I usually stay up at the top of the transport chain. But there are some neat advancements happening down there! Adaptive beam forming, spread spectrum noise avoidance, ever the crazier machines on the other end of some fiber. Seeing the big microwave horns in hillcrest <a href="http://www.co-buildings.com/ca/619/">bottom of 619</a> got me wondering what the physical layer of our internet looks like. At least down in Southern California it’s largely relays of those microwave lines. Kind of wild that these offices used to be filled with human operators routing phone calls!</p>
