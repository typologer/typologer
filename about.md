Typologer is a typology of typologies. A typology is a classification of... stuff. This is a database of databases. There are a lot of beautiful weirdos out there with collections. I've always loved the way special interests cast a lens over the world.

You can see all things in one thing and one thing in all.

If you know a good index I should list, or a good list I should index, holler.
