This is more in the vein of 'very literal' or 'too clever', but I do come back to this website often.
It would also be an egregious mistake if I couldn't make the shittiest pun of a database of databases having a database of databases.
Databases are some of the most advanced pieces of software we have available to us and there is some pretty suprising development in the field, especially around different types of data like objects, timeseries, lossy (whisper is neat), GIS and wide columns.

This is an incredibly deep topic; search, queries and reporting can mean so many different things. This site also has some top notch lists and concise learning materials.
