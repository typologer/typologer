Much in the vein of the fantastic [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/) but specific to the San Diego area.

I've lived here my whole life and honestly boo a little when another favorite place gets posted.

That is to say they are pretty good at surfacing some rad stuff, and indeed the commons can become tragic.
