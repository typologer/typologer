As much as I've loved Fiction, the banal wildness of the reference section has always suprised me with what actually exists in the world.

There's magic in a good collection.

There's some in the drawers full of index cards at the library.
It's in every See Also on wikipedia.
Every record store has a completely different vibe.

There's just so much potential in what all can fit in a database.
Then once reality is ignored and everything is put in a similarly shaped box, you can do math on what you think you see!

Typologer will be making more of the trash the internet is already littered with. Indexes of indexes, listicles of listicles. I want to shine a spotlight on special interest, narrow and wide. I love you, you beautiful weirdos.

This is likely a coping mechanism to deal with the loss (hiatus) of [kottke.org](https://kottke.org/) (please come back)
