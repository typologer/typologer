San Diego, like all cities, has been built and re-built over the years.
The [Save Our Heritage Organisation](https://www.approaching236.com/) (SOHO) tries to keep some of the more interesting bits of architecture around for all to enjoy, but some do get lost to history.

[Normal School](http://www.sohosandiego.org/lostsd/normal.htm) blew me away.
I'd seen the annex driving between North Park and Hillcrest, but I did'nt realize it was the locker room to this grand building that has since been torn down in favor of trailers.

The before and after for [Mission San Luis Rey](http://www.sohosandiego.org/lostsd/sanluisrey.htm) is just too on the nose...
