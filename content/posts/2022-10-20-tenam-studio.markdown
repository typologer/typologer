Tenam is the ambitious project run by [Lexi Pulido](https://www.lexipulido.com/).

She performs every morning at 10AM.
15 minutes of some heart warming, baffling and always beautiful performance art..

Some performances are silent, some have been rather loud.
Some have been poingant and intense while others have been simple and silly.

Everything is Art.

Some guest performances I've seen have included: [Katie Berns](https://katieberns.com/about), [Sean Francis Conway](https://www.theartdonkey.com/) and the delightful duo [Fancy Nancy and Lucy Loop](https://www.moversandgroovers.org/)

The format of the storefront is a beautiful typology in and of itself, but her [blog]({{ page.link }}) will have to do for those that don't live in San Diego.
