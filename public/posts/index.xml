      <description>Tenam is the ambitious project run by Lexi Pulido.
She performs every morning at 10AM. 15 minutes of some heart warming, baffling and always beautiful performance art..
Some performances are silent, some have been rather loud. Some have been poingant and intense while others have been simple and silly.
Everything is Art.
Some guest performances I&amp;rsquo;ve seen have included: Katie Berns, Sean Francis Conway and the delightful duo Fancy Nancy and Lucy Loop</description>

      <description>San Diego, like all cities, has been built and re-built over the years. The [Save Our Heritage Organisation]({{ page.link }}) (SOHO) tries to keep some of the more interesting bits of architecture around for all to enjoy, but some do get lost to history.
Normal School blew me away. I&amp;rsquo;d seen the annex driving between North Park and Hillcrest, but I did&amp;rsquo;nt realize it was the locker room to this grand building that has since been torn down in favor of trailers.</description>

      <description>Much in the vein of the fantastic Atlas Obscura but specific to the San Diego area.
I&amp;rsquo;ve lived here my whole life and honestly boo a little when another favorite place gets posted.
That is to say they are pretty good at surfacing some rad stuff, and indeed the commons can become tragic.</description>

      <description>This one can be fun even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t into Math, just cuz it&amp;rsquo;s pretty&amp;hellip;
This is a list of mathematical knots, not the more useful ones like a bowline. Usually in text books, these knots are drawn flat, but it&amp;rsquo;s cool to see some 3d models that you can rotate.
Billions of knots have been listed, but it&amp;rsquo;s a computationally challenging field.
Computation and textiles go way back
Comparing equivalence can be challenging.</description>

      <description>Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve just listened to too much 99% invisible, but infrastructure can feel so mysterious, ubiquitous and underapreciated.
We sling data around all sorts of ways, and being a programmer I usually stay up at the top of the transport chain. But there are some neat advancements happening down there! Adaptive beam forming, spread spectrum noise avoidance, ever the crazier machines on the other end of some fiber. Seeing the big microwave horns in hillcrest bottom of 619 got me wondering what the physical layer of our internet looks like.</description>

      <description>What about Bob??
Everything about Bob!
This beautiful weirdo has been putting out a calendar for almost 20 years.
Why??

      <description>This is more in the vein of &amp;lsquo;very literal&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;too clever&amp;rsquo;, but I do come back to this website often. It would also be an egregious mistake if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make the shittiest pun of a database of databases having a database of databases. Databases are some of the most advanced pieces of software we have available to us and there is some pretty suprising development in the field, especially around different types of data like objects, timeseries, lossy (whisper is neat), GIS and wide columns.</description>

      <title>Typologer, a typology of typologies</title>

      <description>As much as I&amp;rsquo;ve loved Fiction, the banal wildness of the reference section has always suprised me with what actually exists in the world.
There&amp;rsquo;s magic in a good collection.
There&amp;rsquo;s some in the drawers full of index cards at the library. It&amp;rsquo;s in every See Also on wikipedia. Every record store has a completely different vibe.
There&amp;rsquo;s just so much potential in what all can fit in a database. Then once reality is ignored and everything is put in a similarly shaped box, you can do math on what you think you see!</description>
